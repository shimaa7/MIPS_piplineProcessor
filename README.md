# MIPS_piplineProcessor

You need to implement a working five-stage pipelined mips processor, that can take as input a text file with binary instructions [Which are assembly instructions converted to their binary form, either R format, I format, or J format - There might be online converters for this conversion from assembly to binary or you can use the MARS simulator for mips assembly]. The processor will then read those instructions into its instruction memory and start performing them all just as a true processor will do, updating memory and register file contents. You should support the following instructions in your pipelined implementation (Search for all the information you need regarding the instruction formats and opcodes in the reference or online) : 
[ add - sw - lw - sll - and - or - beq]. You also must implement Memory to ALU forwarding and ALU to ALU forwarding, and handle any other possible hazards by any method of your choice. The important requirement is that the outputs must be completely correct, regardless of your design choices. Thatâ€™s what you would expect from a real processor.
